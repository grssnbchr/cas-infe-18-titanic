## Jupyter Notebook

In project root, change into `src` directory and:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Click the link that opens up a browser window and work on `titanic_*.ipynb`.

Once you want to save, the file `jupyter_notebook_config.py` makes sure a `.py` and `.html` version of the notebook is also saved, making version control easier.
